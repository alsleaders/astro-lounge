# Astro Lounge

The goal of this project was to recreate a website we were given, employing everything that we had learned about HTML, JS, and CSS to make recreate http://sdg-astro-club.surge.sh/.  I was most excited about the two different API calls we got to make for this project and learning how to map over an array provided by an API. 

There are some known bugs in this project.  The next things to be fixed will be:
<ul> 
  <li> fix timer issues (it does not count down correctly now) </li>
  <li> clean up code (now that I have functionality worked out, I can dispense with the console logs) </li>
</ul>
